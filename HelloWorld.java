// =============== LAB SUMMARY ===============

/*
1. What was the hardest part of this lab?
// The two hardest parts of this lab were

and understanding how to save the file properly
to be graded accurately. I am still unsure
if I saved everything correctly, but I hope I did.
2. What will you always remember (never forget) from this exercise?
// I will always remember the learning curve it took
excucute such a simple program. I am definitely excited
to watch my skills grow.
